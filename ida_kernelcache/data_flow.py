# A module for data flows.

"""ida_kernelcache.data_flow

This module contains functions that perform various types of data flow operations on functions or
code ranges. Currently only Arm64 is supported.

While it is possible to implement a very generic data flow framework, allowing custom data flows to
be implemented entirely externally and with little or no knowledge of the underlying architecture,
this module does not take that approach, for reasons of simplicity and efficiency.

    In the flow graph defined by the specified function or code region, find all accesses to the
    memory region pointed to initially by the given register.

    Options:
        function: The address of the function to analyze. Any address within the function may be
            specified. Default is None.
        bounds: A (start, end) tuple containing the start and end addresses of the code region to
            analyze. Default is None.
        initialization: A dictionary of dictionaries, specifying for each instruction start
            address, which registers have which offsets into the memory region of interest. More
            precisely: The keys of initialization are the linear addresses of those instructions
            for which we know that some register points into the memory region of interest. For
            each such instruction, initialization[address] is a map whose keys are the register
            numbers of the registers that point into the memory region. Finally,
            initialization[address][register] is the delta between the start of the memory region
            and where the register points (positive values indicate the register points to a higher
            address than the start). This option must be supplied.
        accesses: If not None, then the given dictionary will be populated with the accesses,
            rather than creating and returning a new dictionary. This dictionary must be of type
            collections.defaultdict(set). Default is None.

    Returns:
        If accesses is None (the default), returns a dictionary mapping each (offset, size) tuple
        to the set of (address, delta) tuples that performed that access.

    Notes:
        Either a function or a code region must be specified. You cannot supply both.

        A common use case is analyzing a function for which we know that one register on entry
        points to a structure. For example, say that the function at address 0x4000 takes as an
        argument in register 10 a pointer 144 bytes in to an unknown structure. The appropriate
        initialization dictionary would be:
            { 0x4000: { 10: 144 } }
