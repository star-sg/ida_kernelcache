"""ida_kernelcache.class_struct

This module is responsible for creating the IDA structs representing the various C++ classes found
in the kernelcache, including the structs for the vtables.

Organization:

Each class Class gets four structs: Class, Class::vtable, Class::vmethods and Class::fields.
Class::vmethods is a struct containing the virtual methods for Class that are not present in its
direct superclass. Class::vtable is a struct representing the virtual method table for Class, laid
out as follows:

    struct Class::vtable {
        struct SuperClass1::vmethods SuperClass1;
        struct SuperClass2::vmethods SuperClass2;
        /* ... */
        struct SuperClassN::vmethods SuperClassN;
        struct Class::vmethods       Class;
    };

Here SuperClass1, ..., SuperClassN are the chain of superclasses of Class starting from the root.
(Remember, XNU's C++ does not have multiple inheritance, which means we only have one ancestor
chain. This makes everything much easier!)

There are two styles for how Class is represented: struct slices and unions.

In the struct slices representation, Class::fields is a struct containing those fields in Class not
present in its superclass, shifted to start at offset 0. Class is a struct organized as follows:

    struct Class {
        struct Class::vtable*      vtable;
        struct SuperClass1::fields SuperClass1;
        struct SuperClass2::fields SuperClass2;
        /* ... */
        struct SuperClassN::fields SuperClassN;
        struct Class::fields       Class;
    };

In the unions representation, Class::fields is also a struct containing the fields in Class not
present in its superclass, however this time it is not shifted, so that the fields occur at the
same offset in Class::fields as they do in the original Class class in the kernel. Class is a
union organized as follows:

    union Class {
        struct Class::vtable*      vtable;
        struct SuperClass1::fields SuperClass1;
        struct SuperClass2::fields SuperClass2;
        /* ... */
        struct SuperClassN::fields SuperClassN;
        struct Class::fields       Class;
    };

There are advantages and disadvantages to each representation. The unions representation can be
more flexible if the automated analysis messes up, but so far I have not found a good way to set
the operands of instructions referring to these structures.

TODO: I know it's probably possible with ida_bytes.op_stroff().

We divide the processing into two parts: vtable generation and class generation.

For vtable generation, we initially ignore the problem of setting types for each virtual method
entry in the struct. The primary reason for this is that the method symbols in the kernelcache
don't include return type information, so we can't be sure what the correct return type for each
method is. In the future, another module will be able to populate the vtable structs with proper
type information.

Class generation is more complicated: We first need to collect the set of accesses to each class
struct, then use that information to reconstruct the class fields. Most of the work is done by the
data_flow module, which collects (offset, size) pairs for each virtual method in the class. We
partiton those accesses to their respective classes by class size. (This is not perfect since the
class size reported in the kernel may actually be rounded up. However, for the most part it works
quite well.) Once we know which (offset, size) pairs correspond to which class, we use the
build_struct module to create the appropriate fields in the struct for those accesses.

Rationale:

IDA structs don't have any form of inheritance, which leaves us two options: We can either create a
single struct for each class and then figure out some way of synchronizing changes along the
inheritance chain, or we can rely on some form of struct inclusion to ensure that the members of
each class are defined only in one place, and all subclasses re-use those members by including them
as a substruct.

While creating one struct for each class with all members for the class and its superclasses is
simple and presents most similarly to the original code, synchronizing this representation across
struct changes is complex, and not possible in general. Consider: If a change is made to a member
of the root class in a leaf class, we would need to propagate that change back to the root and then
down to every subclass of the root class. And if along the way we found another change that was
incompatible, there would be no way to automatically discover the right way to resolve the
conflict. Perhaps this solution would work if we could ensure that the propagation code was run
after every single structure change, so that there was no opportunity to develop conflicts, but at
that point the solution is quite complex and requires direct support from IDA.

Instead, I elected for a representation that forces each field of each class to be defined in only
one place. This means the structures look less like the original C++, which is unfortunate and
complicates adding or looking up members by offset from the start of the class. However, I still
believe it's better to avoid the whole synchronization issue.

Even so, there are still several possible ways of representing the classes, each with their own
advantages and disadvantages. I ended up allowing the user to select their desired representation.

For now, we sidestep the problem of setting type information for the function pointers in the
::vmethods structs. The reason for this, as mentioned above, is that the method symbols don't tell
us what the true return type is, so at best we can guess. It is easy enough to scan through the
vtables after the ::vmethods structs have been generated and add type information then, so I'll
avoid over-complicating this module by trying to do that here. Instead, I imagine another module
(called, for example, types) that provides two functions:
    - initialize_method_types: For each C++ method symbol, sets the method type by effectively
      doing SetType(GuessType(method)) for every method with a good symbol.
    - update_vtable_struct_types: For each field in each ::vmethods struct, look at the type of the
      corresponding method, and set the type of the field accordingly.
